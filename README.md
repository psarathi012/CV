# Technical Content Writer & SEO Expert - CV
## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a technically fluent **AI Engineer turned Technical Writer & SEO Strategist** with a strong grasp of LLM workflows, product-led growth (PLG), and technical content marketing. At **Maxim AI**, I worked closely with the founding team, leading efforts across **AI R&D, SDK development, and technical content**. I fine-tuned models, built POC applications, designed evaluators using LLM-as-a-judge frameworks, and authored cookbooks and teardown blogs to demystify concepts like RAG, agents, and evaluation pipelines.

With hands-on experience in **technical SEO**, I understand how to turn dense engineering topics into content that ranks—merging clarity, context, and conversion. My work bridges engineering precision with storytelling, making me a great fit for roles that need **someone who can code, write, and optimize** all at once.

## ✍️ Technical Writing

At **Maxim AI**, an AI evaluation and observability platform, I authored deeply technical blogs aimed at advancing understanding of LLM performance, evaluation methodologies, and system reliability. These articles were part of our product-led growth (PLG) motion and served dual purposes: educating technical audiences and driving adoption of Maxim's SDK and platform tools.

| Blog Title | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **[LLM Hallucination Detection](https://www.getmaxim.ai/blog/llm-hallucination-detection/)** | Techniques for identifying hallucinated content in LLM outputs using CoT reasoning, reference-based eval, and open-source evaluators. |
| **[Advanced RAG Techniques](https://www.getmaxim.ai/blog/advanced-rag-techniques/)**  | Covers metadata-aware retrieval, custom rerankers, section-aware chunking, and other real-world RAG optimizations. |
| **[Understanding Jailbreaking & Prompt Injection](https://www.getmaxim.ai/blog/jailbreaking-prompt-injection/)** | Teardown of jailbreaking techniques and prompt injection vulnerabilities in LLMs, with mitigation strategies. |
| **[Agent Workflow Memory](https://www.getmaxim.ai/blog/agent-workflow-memory/)**  | Comparison of scratchpad, episodic, and long-term memory in autonomous agent workflows. Includes architecture and use cases. |
| **[LLM as a Jury](https://www.getmaxim.ai/blog/llm-as-a-jury/)**  | Proposed a multi-LLM voting system for generation evaluation—improving reliability over single-judge LLM assessment. |
| **[Synthetic Data Generation](https://www.getmaxim.ai/blog/synthetic-data-generation/)** | Frameworks for generating synthetic evaluation datasets grounded in real-world knowledge bases and domain examples. |

> 🧠 All blog content was **deeply technical**, included **code snippets**, **architectural diagrams**, and **research paper teardowns**. These pieces drove product awareness, SEO traffic, and served as educational content for Maxim AI's observability tooling.
