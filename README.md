# Technical Content Writer & SEO Expert - CV
## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I‚Äôm a technically fluent **AI Engineer turned Technical Writer & SEO Strategist** with a strong grasp of LLM workflows, product-led growth (PLG), and technical content marketing. At **Maxim AI**, I worked closely with the founding team, leading efforts across **AI R&D, SDK development, and technical content**. I fine-tuned models, built POC applications, designed evaluators using LLM-as-a-judge frameworks, and authored cookbooks and teardown blogs to demystify concepts like RAG, agents, and evaluation pipelines.

With hands-on experience in **technical SEO**, I understand how to turn dense engineering topics into content that ranks‚Äîmerging clarity, context, and conversion. My work bridges engineering precision with storytelling, making me a great fit for roles that need **someone who can code, write, and optimize** all at once.
